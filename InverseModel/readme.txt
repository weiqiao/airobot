To envaluate the model, use
multistep_eval3.py
multistep_eval3_2.py
eval.py

File usage:
multistep_eval.py is kind of useless
multistep_eval2.py is to evaluate inverse model from learn_poke_dynamics2.py
multistep_eval3.py is to evaluate forward consistent model from learn_poke_dynamics3.py with far away targets
multistep_eval3_2.py is to evaluate forward consistent model from learn_poke_dynamics3.py with far away targets

Note: goal image generation is only correct in multistep_eval3.py and multistep_eval3_2.py.
